      <br>  
      Summary</h3>
      <p>I grew up rough under the mean streets of Waterdeep. The dank environment of the sewer, along with the harsh treatment of the longshank citizens has shaped me into the indominatable goblin I am today. The time of the humans and elves is over, the time of the under-folk, the goblins, the trolls, the rats and all our kin has come.</p>
