        My name is Evan Kelley and I was born & raised in Austin, Texas. I'm currently working to become a Web Developer, and have been really enjoying styling with CSS. <br> I love to draw, particularly to draw colorful monsters and critters. I also enjoy playing Table Top RPG games like D&D with my friends. I'm not really sure what to put here honestly.
